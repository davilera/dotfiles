# My Omarchy-Based Dotfiles

Welcome! This is my personal dotfiles, meant to live _on top of_ an [**Omarchy**
installation](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy).

This repo captures my personal preferences, developer tooling, and integrations,
especially tuned for WordPress plugin development. Use it as a base, fork it, or
adapt pieces for your own workflow. üòä

## Structure & What Lives Here

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve organized things:

| Folder            | Purpose / What you‚Äôll find inside                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bin/`            | Handy scripts I use often (e.g. wrappers shortcuts)                                                                       |
| `composer/`       | My global Composer setup files                                                                                            |
| `dconf/`          | Exports of GNOME/GTK (or related) settings I care about                                                                   |
| `git/`            | My gitconfig, hooks, aliases, etc                                                                                         |
| `hypr/`           | Hyprland bindings, customizations, layouts                                                                                |
| `kitty/`          | Keybindings, tweaks, theme tweaks for the Kitty terminal                                                                  |
| `meld/`           | A custom `gtksourceview-4` style (using Catppuccin Mocha) for Meld                                                        |
| `nvim/`           | My LazyVim / Neovim config, including plugin choices                                                                      |
| `shell/`          | My shell setup (currently Bash): aliases, ENV tweaks, nvm logic, etc                                                      |
| `smassh/`         | My ‚Äúsuper minimal SSH‚Äù / simpler SSH config layer (with Catppuccin theming)                                               |
| `tooling-config/` | Global configs (ESLint, prettier, stylelint, etc) so tooling _without per-project defines_ still follows WordPress style  |
| `trash/`          | A systemd ‚Äútask‚Äù (timer + service) to periodically purge old items from the ‚Äútrash‚Äù (for me, I alias `rm` to `trash-cli`) |
| `uwsm/`           | Config files inherited from Omarchy‚Äôs `uwsm` (user workflow / session manager) with my custom overlays                    |
| `waybar/`         | Config files inherited from Omarchy‚Äôs `waybar` with my custom overlays                                                    |

Additionally, there is an `install.sh` script at the root whose job is:

1. Install a curated list of packages I use daily
2. Configure and bootstrap certain assets (e.g. Inkscape extensions, `navi`
   cheats, etc)
3. Globally install some `npm` packages I rely on
4. Stow (or symlink) all the config folders above into the right places
5. Apply a few extra tweaks / customizations using Omarchy‚Äôs own functions

---

## How to Use / Full Installation

Here‚Äôs how I expect someone (or future me) to apply this setup:

1. **Start with a working Omarchy install**  
   This repo is not a _replacement_ for Omarchy ‚Äî it‚Äôs an overlay. Make sure
   Omarchy is installed and functioning (Hyprland, `uwsm`, etc). See the [Omarchy
   GitHub page](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) for official docs.

2. **Clone or download this repo**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/davilera/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ```

3. **Review `install.sh`**
   It‚Äôs polite (and safe) to read through the logic before execution.

4. **Run the installer**

    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

If at any point you want to revert or remove the overlay, you can remove the
symlinks / stows, and selectively disable parts you don‚Äôt want.

## Assumptions & Caveats

- **This repo assumes Omarchy is already installed** (i.e. it does _not_ replicate
    or replace Omarchy‚Äôs core setup)
- My tooling choices (linters, formatter rules, plugin settings) are heavily
    influenced by WordPress coding standards and plugin ecosystem norms
- If a project you work on already defines its own tooling (e.g. `.eslintrc`,
    `.phpcs.xml`), those will usually take priority over my global one (I hope
    so)
- Always back up your existing configs before running the install script
- Use this as a scaffold or reference, and feel free to remove, replace, or
    adapt parts you don‚Äôt like (duh)

## Acknowledgments & Thanks

Huge thanks to **DHH** for creating **Omarchy** and maintaining a slick,
opinionated dev environment.

Thanks also to all the folks in the open source world whose work I rely on.

Feel free to reuse, fork, and adapt. This repo is not meant to be a starting
point for anyone, but that‚Äôs up to you. Actually, you know what? If you build
something cool on top of it, let me know!

Happy hacking! üßµ
